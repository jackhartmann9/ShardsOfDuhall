Shard of Duhall
Combining Video Games with Board games in a unique party game.
Game is Currently in production

**
While sitting down for a weekly LAN party, our group tries playing a new game called “Duhall”. 
However, when they insert the disk it fractures into hundreds of tiny pieces and 
our group of players is sucked into their respective computers. 
Now, the players must compete in 6 different mini games to try and get the most Shards of Duhall and 
escape the game first or be lost forever within the “Shards of Duhall”.
